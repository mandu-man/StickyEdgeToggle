#Toggle Mouse Sticky Edges (Ubuntu - Unity)

On a multi monitor setup, configuring sticky edges(*ie Mouse getting stuck at screeen border*) is a long task.
Sticky edges can be useful if you're working on just a single monitor, so the mouse doesn't accidentally jump to another screen.


###Usage:

Make it executable:
`chmod +x toggle_sticky.sh`
Execute
`./toggle_sticky.sh`
